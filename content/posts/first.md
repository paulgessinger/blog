This theme is using the colors from the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)
palette, icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and fonts from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

All assets, however, are hosted under this domain, so no external CDNs are
used. This might be overkill for GDPR compliance, but is definitely the safe
route to avoid transmitting visitors' personally identifiable information (such
as IP addresses) to external providers for things as simple as these.

Other notable absences: **JavaScript** :thumbsup:

The whole thing comes together using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site/blog generator written in Go. Still missing: CI and CD (automatic deployment to a web server).

UPDATE: automatic deployment using GitHub actions is working too now!
