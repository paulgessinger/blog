Hi! I'm a PhD student in physics currently working on my thesis at CERN,
Switzerland. I got a Bachelor's and
[Master's](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2276657) degree from Mainz
University, and have been working towards that PhD since 2017.

I'm interested in all things software. I used to do a lot of web
development on the side during my studies, and am still interested in
everything that's new and (or) exciting. These days, I mostly write C++ for the
reconstruction software of the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern), as well
as an experiment independent particle track reconstruction library called
[Acts](https://cern.ch/acts). Apart from that, I do a non-negligible amount of
Python, for configuration, steering things, and because Python is amazing!

I'm into photography, and have been taking pictures (mostly on trips) using a
Nikon DSLR for ~15 years.
